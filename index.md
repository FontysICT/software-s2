Software Demand Based - Semester 2
=====================================

Software engineering is an integral process where you start with a problem, from which a suitable product must be designed and implemented. The biggest challenge is getting a clear vision what the problem is, and how to fix it in the most applicable manner. Most applicable' because the goal is not to always find the most perfect solution to the problem itself, but to manage all considerations related to the context of the problem, and then finding the sweet spot. 

Some considerations can be, for instance:
 - **Cost** 
    - Cost of development, maintainance, hosting, etc
 - **Time to market** 
    - when does the customer want it, so how fast can we have a working solution
 - **Technical constraints** 
    - Maybe the 'best' solution would be to use technique A, but the customer only has people who can maintain technique B.

So all these constraints might result in a whole different solution then first considered.

# From problem to solution
But how to you find the most applicable solution? In software development there are different stages, and depending of the type of development process your team follows it is a lineair or a more iterative ordeal, where every step returns for every iteration.

### Software development stages
1. Software Analysis
    * Context definition
    * Requirements
    * Concept Model
    * Use Cases
    * Test Cases
2. Software Design
    * Architecture Model
    * Domain Model
    * ERD *(Database design)*
3. Implemantation
4. Quality Assurance *(Testing)*
5. Manage and Control *(e.g. Maintainance)*
